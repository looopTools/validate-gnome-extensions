* Curated List of Validate Gnome Extensions

*WARNING:* This is a list I maintain on my own.

*WARNING:* I have no responsbility if the plugin suddenly have malicous code in it.

*NOTE:* I provide this list 100% warranty free. I cannot be held responsible if something goes wrong.

The Gnome Desktop Environment relies heavily on extensions for customisation of the user experience.
This allows Gnome to provide a fairly minimal system from the start.

However, blindly installing extensions can be a security risk as these basically allow for code execution on your device.
Whilst plugins uploaded to [[extensions.gnome.org][extensions.gnome.org]] are reviewed, something can slip through the eyes of reviewers.
Therefore, I have started to review some plugins, such that I can promise others that in a specific version they are safe to use.

* Process

My verification process is a follows:

- Read and understand the code in the code repository linked from [[extensions.gnome.org][extensions.gnome.org]].
- In a virtual machine with Fedora and newest gnome available there install the plugin.
  - Verify that the installed plugin code match the repository code
- Describe the plugin verified
